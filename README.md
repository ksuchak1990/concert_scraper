# concert_scraper

A webscraper to collect the gigs happening in the surrounding area.
For a detailed explanation of how the webscraper has been constructed, see `./docs/main.pdf`.

For those looking to get started quickly, running

```python main.py```

will collect data regarding concerts occuring in Leeds, reformat the data to a CSV file, and finally plot some visualisations displaying trends in concerts around the city.

## Ideas

* Archiving previous outputs.
* Outputting richer data.
* Merging historical data.
