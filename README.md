# Programming for Social Scientists: Core Skills - Requirements

This assessment is a major project building up a model, application, or analysis from scratch. 
The project can be either something of your own invention, or one of the projects below. 
You are welcome to build an agent-based model using the assessment 1 material as a starting point, but as this material won't be marked twice, significant additional content will need adding.

Broadly speaking, your project should:
* Read in some data.
* Process it in some way.
* Display the results.
* Write the results to a file.

The submission should include all the code and data needed to run the project, along with instructions as to how to run it. 
Code written by you should be supplied as source code as well as compiled code if that is necessary (and it is not expected that code will be compiled). 
If material does not run on Windows systems, please discuss this with the main module contact before developing and submitting the project, likewise if it will involve confidential data or proprietary software. 
The submission should also include 
* a UML diagram showing either the code structure or flow, and 
* a short document (under (usually much under) 2000 words) detailing
	* the intention of the software, 
	* issues during development and how these were overcome (or not), 
	* general sources used, 
	* the thought processes going into the software design, and 
	* the software development process followed.

This document is intended to give a brief context for the software, explaining how it ended up how it is, such that any issues can be understood and marked appropriately; it is not intended to be a lengthy investigation into the problem area solved by the software, unless that is absolutely necessary for understanding the software.

All components will be marked against the standard coding marking scheme. 
For the code, this means whether it works as intended, but also the presentation, adherence to community standards, and commenting/documentation. 
You should make sure that your code is appropriately licensed.

Submission of the project should be by uploading a zipped file containing all the relevant components to the Minerva VLE system; an appropriate assessment upload area can be found under the module listing for this module.
